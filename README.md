# Emphasis Code:
```
NOTE: Each line, except last, ends with two spaces "  " to prevent wrapping  
Bold - **Bold** or __Bold__ (double asterisks or underscores)  
Italics - *Italics* or _Italics_ (single asterisks or underscores)  
Strikethrough - ~~Strikethrough~~ (double tildes)
```

# Table Code:

**Note**: Tables columns are defined by pipes (|), the header row is
defined by inserting at least 3 hyphens (---) on the line below. You
can set the alignment of each column using colons (:) on the header
defining row, left (:---), center (:---:), right (---:).  You can align
things with spaces but it will occur automatically in the simple version
below

```
Gene | Chromosome | Cancer Gene | Note
:--- | :---: | ---: | ---
TRAF3 | 14 | Yes | col1 left aligned
WHSC1L1 | 8 | No | col2 centered
RB1 | 13 | Yes | col3 right aligned
```

# Code Block Code:

**Note**: Code blocks can be indicated by either 4 spaces ("    ") or above
and below wrapped with three back ticks (```). The advantage of back
ticks is it allows the definition of the code type so language specific
syntax coloring can occur. In the example below the set of code blocks
are indented with four spaces and then the back ticks used in the example
are shown.

    ```python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print(s)
    ```
    
    ```bash
    i="Bash syntax highlighting"
    echo ${i}
    exit 1
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    ```
    
    ```
    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
    But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
    ```
